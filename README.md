# Python, Colab, AI Pair Programmer Tutorial
As part of my Data Mining coursework, I have created this repository to display my work for this assignment. As part of the assignment, I have divided this repository into three folders for each subsection.
1. The first subsection follows Derek Banas' Python tutorial and implements some basic and advanced Colab features.
2. The second subsection is to show the work done using the Cursor tool to generate and implement a basic webpage integrated with Python code and perform Titanic Survivor classification. It also contains a YouTube link to a walkthrough of the video.
3. The third subsection is to show the work done using the AutoML No Code tool Akkio.com for predicting California Housing Dataset. It also contains a YouTube link to a walkthrough of the video.

For more details on each subsection, please open their respective readme.md files.
