# AutoML No Code Tutorial

For this section, I experimented with the AutoML No Code tool on Akkio.com to create a model for California Housing Price Prediction. Akkio.com is a platform to work on prompt-based no-code Data Science projects. For this usecase, I was able to perform the following steps using a prompt:
1. Clean and normalize the dataset.
2. Change the datatypes of the columns.
3. Create different vizs (scatterplot, boxplot, geospatial plot, histogram).
4. Train the model.
5. Analyze the performance and impact of different attributes.

For a detailed walkthrough, watch the [walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2om0brlqj3w) I uploaded for the same.
