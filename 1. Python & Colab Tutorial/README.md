# Python & Colab Tutorial

For this section, I went through the following videos on Python and Google Colab.
* [Python Programming by Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA)
* [Practical Introduction to Google Colab for Data Science by Data Professor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCngVVBSsmA)
* [Advanced Google Colaboratory - Korakot Chaovavanich by PyCon Thailand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxBWBeDnLt8)

Following that, I implemented all the basic concepts of Python in a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10ruOch7L5YTE6UKo5HpakbRtvjCi5-BA?usp=sharing) while displaying some of the basic and advanced Colab features from the videos.
